The Deep Q Network proposed in [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) has been implemented

Few improvements to the orignal model has been proposed
<br>While the original model has an average score of 398.73 across all episodes, the proposed model has an average score of 452.01
